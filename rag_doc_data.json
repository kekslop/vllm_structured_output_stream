Starvest's strategy to steer its portfolio toward precious metal investments in recent years has enabled the Company to position itself attractively for the current environment. Although improved investor sentiment boosted certain precious metal stocks and those of certain other natural resource companies, gold prices declined 5.5% for the year ended 30 September 2022. The post-pandemic global economy and interest rate hikes, particularly in the US, have kept prices flat recently but we continue to believe that there is a solid foundation for precious metals going forward.\n\nOur investment portfolio decreased approximately 56% in the year to 30 September 2022 to £6 million. However, the discount to net asset value narrowed by 5 percentage points, from 34% to 29% as at 30 September 2022, which is a significant improvement for shareholders.\n\nGreatland Gold plc (AIM:GGP) remains our primary investment, with its Havieron gold-copper discovery in Australia. Havieron's initial inferred resource increased from 4.2M oz gold equivalent\\* to 6.5M oz gold equivalent\\*\\* during the year. The company secured funding through to production, expanded its board, and delivered operational and financial improvements. While the share price has decreased over the last year, this is not uncommon for a company in pre-production and we continue to see potential gains here.\n\nAriana Resources continues to expand its exploration and development footprint in Europe. As the Kiziltepe mine has continued to meet production expectations, Ariana has focused on other projects in Turkey, such as Tavsan, which is scheduled for first production in H2 2023. The alliance with Newmont, via its West Tethyan holding, allows considerable scope to explore southeastern Europe over the next five years, and the recently acquired Kosovo licence shows an interesting start to this US\\$2.5m agreement. Together with the Asgard Metals Fund, Ariana's exploration and development projects have expanded considerably since the company's founding twenty years ago.\n\nCora Gold continued to de-risk its Sanankoro project as it completed further drilling and increased its mineral resource estimate by 14% while completing a feasibility study. After year-end the company announced that it had received the Environmental Permit required for the project, a significant step forward.\n\nWe believe that the long-term outlook for gold prices remains favourable and we remain committed to our strategy.\n\n\\* GGP RNS dated 10 December 2020 \\*\\* GGP RNS dated 3 March 2022\n\n#### Investing policy\n\nThe Company's investing policy is set forth on page 3 of this report and made available on our website, www.starvest.co.uk.\n\n#### Trading portfolio valuation\n\nA brief review of the major portfolio companies follows from page 6. Other investee companies are listed on the websites from which further information may be obtained.\n\n#### Shareholder information\n\nThe Company's shares are traded on AIM. Announcements made to the London Stock Exchange are available from the Company's website, www.starvest.co.uk, where historical reports and announcements are also available.\n\nCallum N Baxter Chairman 07 February 2023"
